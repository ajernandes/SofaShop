<h1>Sofa Shop - The Game</h1>

<p>This was inspired by <a href = "https://www.unmade.fm">The Unmade Podcast</a></p>

<h2>How to play</h2>
Move your mouse left to right to match the sofa to the curtains. Future plans can be found below.
<h2>Installation</h2>
Sofa Shop - The Game is created in <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> using <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a>. <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted"> <br>
Here</a> is a link to the Pygame installation instructions. <br>
Once pygame is installed, download the game files from <a href="https://www.github.com/ajernandes/SofaShop">GitHub</a>.<br>
In the top right corner, click on the green <b>Code</b> button, and select <b>Download ZIP</b> at the bottom. <br>(If you are familiar with git, that will also work)<br>

Once you have downloaded the zip file, you need to extract it, and open the folder contained inside of it.<br>
Next, we need to open this file inside of the terminal. This can generally be done by right clicking the folder, depending on your operation system. Google is your friend.<br>
Once you have the folder opened inside of your terminal, type <code>python3 main.py</code>. If you do not hear the music, try restarting your computer.<br>
