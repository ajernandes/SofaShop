Once you have downloaded the zip file, you need to extract it, and open the folder contained inside of it.<br>
Next, we need to open this file inside of the terminal. This can generally be done by right clicking the folder, depending on your operating system. Google is your friend.<br>
Once you have the folder opened inside of your terminal, type <code>python3 main.py</code>. If you do not hear the music, try restarting your computer.<br>
